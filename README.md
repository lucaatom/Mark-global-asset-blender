# Mark global asset blender

Blender is one of the best opensource piece of art out there. 
With the 3.0 version there is a new feature called Asset Browser. It's a great idea but it lacks some basic functionality like saving global assets.
I don't know why this has not been implemented by default but in the meanwhile you can use my script.

It works by marking the object as an asset and then saving the file in the first assets path set in the preferences.

Warning: 
 1 - if you save global assets from different files but with the same filename one will override the other
 2 - can't save assets with the same name

TODO
Avoid overwriting files with the same name by using an unique id that unique identify the original file.
